// proving that 1-> True and 0-> False in javascipt

let hasafish = true
console.log(hasafish+15) //-> answer comes to be 15 meaning the expression should have something like(0+15)
// when changed to true it comes to be 16 meaning that the value of hasafish must be 1 
// so this proves that JS takes 1 as true and 0 as false.
