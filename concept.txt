Variables in JavaScript:
Three ways to declare a variable in JS var, let and const.

-> Usually in java or other programming language we have a way of creating variables,
Int name_of_the_variable and its value. This type of languages are called as Strongly typed languages,
cause the datatype would not be able to change once declared.

JS -> Loosely typed language, datatype is assigned dynamically.

The scope of Var is global. meaning a variable that is declared using Var can be used,
outside of any conditional block, switch case statement in a general way we can use it anywhere inside our file.


let would be having a local scope that is the only difference with var and it is also a loosely typed variable declaration.

Const -> Its scope is always local, the value of the variable created using const cannot be changed once assigned.
-> When the variable is created using const we need to assign the value during the time of creation we cannot leave it unassign.


Difference between null and undefined.

If there is a value that is existing but at the moment it is not present then it cane be said as null
and other can be termed as undefined

// Interesting thing about JS is that when you are trying to multiply number and a string JS would consider the string as the number and perform the multiplication operation.
('1234'*1) -> 1234


// DOM manipulation:
Document object model. -> HTML in terms of the browser we can it as DOM
