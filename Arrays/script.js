// but if we try to reassign a complete new array to student variable it wont be possible due to the constant variable declaration.

  // we can use the slice function to get the sub part from any array, it would be 
  // taking a starting index and a end index so we need to be carefull when we provide the end index cause,
  // we always need to give the last index+1 to get the exact element.

   let subarray = numbers.slice(1,4) // return a new array, just give the index of the first element and take the element you want and add one to its index to get the desired part.

   // splice would be helping us to remove elements from the array like a specific portion.
   // one key thing to understand here is that splice would be returing a new array with the element we needed and also would be removing those elements from the original array as well.

    // [1,2.3,4,5] splice(1,3) -> [2,3,4]
     //original array [1,5]
